![Nodemonkes Mosaic](/mosaic_logo_dark.png)

This is the nodemonkes mosaic! All 10,000 Nodemonkes are represented exactly once. 

To find a particular nodemonkey, search for the number in the txt file, look at the line number and go to that number. Each row has 100 monkes, so for monke 201, go to the third row and look at the first monke.
